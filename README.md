# BarçaSeasons - CS50x Final Project

This simple web application was created as a final project for the CS50x course “Introduction to Computer Science”.
The idea came from personal experience as a football supporter (namely, of the Football Club “Barcelona”).

### Purpose of the app

After many years of rooting for the club I often struggle to recall the tournament significance of a particular game (for example, when watching highlights).
Existing free services privide results for particular games or the final standings for a season. Services that dynamically show past title races and intermadiary standings
are hard to find.

The goal of the app is to fill this gap and to provide a simple tool to check Spanish LaLiga table at any given moment during ten past seasons.

### How to use

The user interface is pretty simple. There are two webpages: "Home" and "Simulation". Homepage shows the list of seasons available.
User can pick a season for simulation by clicking a button with dates (i.e. "2021/2022')
"Simulation' page displays the standings after each consecutive Round and corresponding games with scores. 
Navigation buttons ("First", "Previous", "Next", "Last") allow to move to the next or to the previous round as well as to jump
straight to te end or to the beginning of the season.

### Implementation

Standings are calculated by a script ("standings.py") which takes as an input games and scores. The script assigns points and keeps track of secondary data (i.e. goal difference).
Then it sorts the teams in accordance with official LaLiga regulations. Main sorting criteria is the amount o points. When multiple teams have equal points script uses tie-breaker rules:
- results of head-to-head games (only when both head-to-head games have already been played)
- head-to-head doal difference
When both head-to-head games were not yet played:
- total goal difference
- total goals scored

Data with games and scores was taken from the site of [RSSSF project](http://www.rsssf.com/) and stored in SQLite database.
Since necessary data at RSSSF page is stored as a single HTML block with pre-formatted text, I implemented another script ("parser.py")
to extract and store the information by using tools from Selenium and Re libraries.

The Flask-application contains routes with embedded SQL SELECT-queries. Since all the data is preprocesses and stored in the database, tha app itself is responsible
only for the display of the results of the SELECT-queries. This structure of the app assures quick performance.

### Technologies used

- languages: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS
- frameworks: Flask, Bootstrap
- Python libraries: sqlite3, selenium, re
